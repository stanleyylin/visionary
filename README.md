Do your eyes ever feel strained and dry after hours and hours spent staring at screens? Has your eye doctor ever told you about the 20-20-20 rule? Good thing we’ve automated it for you along with personalized analysis of your eye activity using AdHawk’s eye tracking device.

# What it does
Poor eye health has become a prominent health issue. The solution? Meet Visionary. While you’re working at your desktop, you’ll wear the wonderful Adhawk glasses. Every 20 minutes or so, our connected app will alert you to look away for a 20 second eye break. With the eye tracking, you’ll be forced to look at least 20 feet–otherwise, the timer pauses.
